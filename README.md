That useful example of elm and pouchdb

This resembles a dashboard like you would like to use if you observe a production process, where you can observe the production parameters passes/fails/yield per production LOT lives.

The data comes in from a CouchDB database, replicated into the browser using pouchdb.

## Goal

I wanted to learn a new language and try the hype for the "ELM" language myself in a problem space that I feel related to.

## Result

The learning curve of ELM consisted of a few hours of bumping against obstacles without making any progress whatsoever. This is frustrating and it spreaded out over about 2 days.

After that, I started to get it, and things started to make sense. The type safety made sure that all solutions I got working in the browser run deterministically.

### Code size and complexity
The application is not optimally partitioned, and the ELM part does more of the logic than it should, but I was interested in learning that I did it anyhow.

The total code size is large compared to an equivalent streamlit solution, but.:

 - offline capability
 - virtual dom
 - robustness
 
 These are features that are valuable.
 
 ### It is not pretty
 Yes I know
